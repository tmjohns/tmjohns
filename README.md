- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tmjohns. I'm currently working in the banking/finance industry as a scrum master and technical business analyst. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ensuring that technology is used to increase accessibility, equity and inclusion. Society is rapidly demonstrating that we can solve almost any technical problem. Making the intentional choices necessary to do so in a way that ensures everyone can benefit will pose significant challenges.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Masters in IT Management. My thesis is looking at the role of servant leadership in the success of agile transformation programs within organisations.
